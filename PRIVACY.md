## 1. Data Collection

We **do not** collect, store, transmit, or sell any personal data.

All operations are performed **locally** in your browser.  
No information leaves your device.

---

## 2. Data Processing

The extension processes data **only** when you explicitly click the **Export to PDF** button.

Steps:

1. The extension extracts profile information from the active LinkedIn tab.
2. Data is temporarily stored in `chrome.storage.local` to transfer it to the print view.
3. Once the print view is loaded, the temporary data is **immediately deleted**.

## 3. External Requests

The extension does **not** make any network requests to external servers.  
It works entirely offline once loaded.

## 4. Permissions Usage

- **`activeTab`** — Needed to read the content of the currently active LinkedIn profile tab after you click export.
- **`storage`** — Used only for short-term data transfer between scripts; cleared immediately after printing.
- **`scripting`** — Allows injecting content scripts programmatically if needed for compatibility.
